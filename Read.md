# Scheduler
Scheduler is a application that allows the user to plan their day by adding events to specific time slots.
The user can enter their event in the box next to the desired time slot. Once the user has typed their event into the box, then click on the 'Add Event' button to save the event into a local storage. 
When the user refreshes the page, their event is saved in the time slot they selected to add their event.
